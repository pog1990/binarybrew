##Replace Caffeine Menubar Icons (by Young Kang)

Caffeine Mac app is very popular and useful app. I recently change my 2010 mid MBP to 2015 NEW MBP. And the original Caffeine menubar icons really annoyed me. Because of non retina, and old fashioned shapes of icons. There are many good icons to use, but I wanna use the app with my own design. I inspired from coffee server. Recentely I'm into drinking hand drip coffee with my coworkers.

There are cute and normal versions of icons. You can change the app icons with following instructions. It's SUPER EASY :)

---

1. Download the attachment. Unarchive .zip file and copy All the images in the "01_cute icons" OR "02_normal icons"(You can choose the icons style)
2. Go to your applications folder. Right click “Caffeine” and click “Show Package Contents”. Go into Contents folder, then into Resources folder.
3. Paste the images in the folder.(Make sure the app is closed) If it ask of you wanna replace the images, click yes.
4. Open Caffeine and enjoy the icons!

* If you use dark mode of Mac, just switch the name of files "active" to "highlightactive" and "inactive" to "highlighted". Then the color will reversed.
