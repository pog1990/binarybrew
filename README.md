# Binary Brew

Binary Brew is a simple and lightweight app for Apple OSX that keeps your screen awake. It loads a coffee cup icon in the menu bar at the top of your computer screen. You can turn it on, off, or set a timer for 15, 30, or 60 minutes. While the app is active, your screen will not turn off. Binary Brew achieves this by running a background command that prevents the screen from sleeping.
